Our Current Process

This is our current workflow. This is an important set of steps so document them:

<ol>
<li>Pull the latest develop branch.</li>
<li>Start a new feature branch.</li>
<li>Once feature is finished, create JAR file.</li>
<li>Update and test Docker configuration with GitHub Actions.</li>
<li>Update feature branch with develop to ensure feature is up-to-date.</li>
<li>Check feature branch still works.</li>
<li>Merge feature branch into develop.</li>
<li>Repeat 2-7 until release is ready.</li>
<li>Merge develop branch into release and create release.</li>
<li>Merge release into master and develop.</li>
</ol>
